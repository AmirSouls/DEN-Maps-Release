### Items & Quality-of-Life

Here's a quick summary of the various Quality-of-Life features and items you can find on our maps

ðŸ”¸ **Multi-map play**: The map is usable at all times in this mod, and doesn't require a vote for players to travel. Players can exist between multiple maps at once in the same session without any of the usual desync issues.  
ðŸ”¸ **No Seamless Rot**: Seamless Co-op has a PvE balance feature where subsequent deaths builds up "Rot". A series of special items that stack various debuffs on your character which are only cleared upon resting a grace. Since this is a PvP mod, this feature is disabled for obvious QoL reasons.

ðŸ”¸ **Item: Braid of Marika**: Use this item to toggle on/off automatic revival on death.  
ðŸ”¸ **Regressive Grease**: Use this item to quickly and on-demand fully heal and restore your character to it's normal state, a bit like using a grace.  
ðŸ”¸ **O'Jar of Plenty**: Use this item to toggle on/off infinite usage of goods.
